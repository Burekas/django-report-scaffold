What is Django Report Scaffold?
-------------------------------
You have an app and it probably needs reports. Scaffold reports will help you streamline the process and present
users with a consistent interface. Think of it like Django admin for reports. It features:

- Stock report filtering
- Highly extentable - Keep with stock filters or make your own. 
- Export to xlsx, admin change list page, django-report-builder, or appy POD templates. Extend and add your own exports!
- Ready to go user interface allows users to quickly filter reports.
- Filter system encourages you to keep your report logic organized. Filters can change a queryset or change report contextthat might affect other filters.
